## üìù Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types
- Avoid `any` type
- Use interfaces over types when possible

**Example:**
```typescript
interface ServiceCardProps {
  service: Service
  enablePing?: boolean
}
```

### React

- Functional components only
- Use hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Keep components focused (single responsibility)
- Extract reusable logic to custom hooks

**Example:**
```typescript
export default function ServiceCard({ service }: ServiceCardProps) {
  const [status, setStatus] = useState<ServiceStatus>()
  // ...
}
```

### CSS

- Use CSS Modules for component styles
- Follow BEM-like naming
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use CSS custom properties for theming

**Example:**
```css
.card {
  /* Base styles */
}

.card:hover {
  /* Hover state */
}

.cardTitle {
  /* Element styles */
}
```

### Commits

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issues when applicable

**Good Commits:**
```
Add Grafana icon to icon library

Fix theme switching bug in Safari

Update README with Docker deployment instructions
```
